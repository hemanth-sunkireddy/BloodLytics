# Data Visualisation Project 

## BloodLytics: Visualising Blood Donation Statistics

This project revolves around a detailed analysis of blood donation statistics, including 
donor demographics, donation frequency, and regional supply-demand
imbalances. Sourcing relevant datasets from reputable health organizations and
blood banks forms the basis for uncovering barriers to blood donation participation.

correlate with donation rates?
(d) Are there geographical disparities in blood donation availability and
accessibility?
(e) Find the districts with no blood banks or donations availability?
